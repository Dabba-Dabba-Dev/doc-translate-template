                             SHADOWING PRACTICE 08
       The city has contracted with Acme Construction to improve certain
         roads in your neighborhood.  Work will commence on June 3rd, as
     shown in the project schedule. This work will require road closures at
      certain times throughout the project. We will be starting work
    at 7:00 AM and will finish around 5:00 PM. If you are within the active
      work zone limits and park your car in your driveway at night, please
     be sure to move it prior to the 7:00 AM start time. We understand that
      this may be a short-term inconvenience and we hope to work together
       with you in a professional manner for the long-term improvement of
      your neighborhood.
